Play Framework & the Gilt API
=============================

This simple application demonstrates usage of the [Play Framework (v2.1.1)](http://www.playframework.com/).

It was built as a guided tutorial for a [Play Framework NYC Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/).

The application is an interface to the [Gilt Public API](http://dev.gilt.com/). Its goal is to demonstrate typical Play usage including:

+ Routing, Controllers, and the Action Request/Result lifecycle.
+ WS, the web service library, using configuration to pull data out of the host environment.
+ Future composition and Async Results.
+ JSON parsing and unmarshaling.
+ The Play templating engine and Asset management.
+ Testing

The application can be found running on: http://play-gilt.herokuapp.com/

The presentation deck that helped guide this app can be found on SpeakerDeck: https://speakerdeck.com/mwunsch/play2-up-and-running

This app is incomplete. Feel free to fork the application to continue developing it on your own. Issues and Pull Requests are available on this app, and discussion and commentary of the design are strongly encouraged. Ultimatly this is a learning tool to help introduce the core concepts of the Play Framework. Good luck and have fun.
